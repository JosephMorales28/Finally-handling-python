"""Each coffee option has its own number, starting with 0. Write a program that  will take a number from the customer as input from the customer and serve the corresponding coffee type. If the customer enters a number that is out of the accepted range, the program should output 'Invalid number'. Regardless of coffee option result, the program should output 'Have a good day' at the end.
